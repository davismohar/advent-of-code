# 2022 Kotlin

There is a fixed directory structure assumed by the Util functions. Put the test input in `/src/test/resources/{problem}/test.txt` 
and the real input in `/src/main/resources/{problem}/input.txt` 

To run tests:
```shell
./gradlew test
```

To generate real output:
```shell
./gradlew run
```
