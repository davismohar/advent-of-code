There is a fixed directory structure assumed by the Util functions. Put the test input in a `{problem}` directory as `test.txt` and the real input in as `input.txt`

To run the test scenario:
```bash
runHaskell {puzzleNumber} test
```

To run against the real input:
```bash
runHaskell {puzzleNumber}
```
